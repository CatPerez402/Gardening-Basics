# Gardening-Basics
Users can find what plants to plant each month, information about those plants and sustainability.
Gardening Basics allows users to find out what plants to plant each month and information about those plants. In addition, Gardening Basics allows for the option to learn about sustainability through gardening. Gardening Basics is based on USDA Hardiness Zone 10a. USDA Hardiness Zones separate regions by their climate and plant growth. This program contains functions, for and while loops, vectors and arrays, if and else if statements, switch case, and classes and objects. To find out what plants to plant each month, the program uses arrays, switch case, and for loops to output the plants. To find out information about plants, the program uses a for loop, vectors, class and objects to output 24 plants and information about them like name, month to plant them, type, gemination and harvest. Lastly, to learn about sustainability, the program uses output statements and functions. All these options are then combined in a while loop.
